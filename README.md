# AdventureBot


AdventureBot is a Discord bot that powers a turnâ€‘based dungeon adventure. It uses MySQL to store game sessions and data while gameplay logic lives in the `game` package. The `hub` package manages server setup and player interactions.

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10+
- **MySQL** server
- A Discord application with a bot token and the necessary intent permissions
- Python packages `discord.py` and `mysql-connector-python`

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install discord.py mysql-connector-python
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` in the project root and provide your own credentials. A typical configuration looks like:

```json
{
    "discord_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
    "mysql": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "user": "root",
        "password": "password",
        "database": "adventure"
    }
}
```

## Database setup 

The database_setup.py script is needed for successful bot startup, it is used to check and verify a standard database with minimal default setup.
The included seed info in this script is legacy and depricated, but is considered the base install of the database which is required for the bot to work. 

A more recent version of the schema (based on patch 3.0.9) is provided at `database/dump.sql`. Import it if you need to prepopulate the database:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p <database> < database/dump.sql
```

## Running the bot

Create a small launcher script that instantiates `commands.Bot`, loads the cogs from the `hub` and `game` packages, and then calls `bot.run()` using the token from `config.json`.

Once the launcher is ready, start the bot with:

```bash
python run_bot.py
```

Slash commands such as `/adventuresetup` will then be available in your server.
=======
## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the project root or provide the settings via
environment variables. An example configuration is available in
`config.example.json`.

Environment variables will override values found in `config.json`:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- `MYSQL_HOST`
- `MYSQL_USER`
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`

If a variable is not provided, the loader falls back to the value in
`config.json`.
